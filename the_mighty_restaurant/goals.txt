Page for owner that shows each order completed in past 24 hours and will show
the amount of money made per day for past week?

List of drinks?

How to make multiple selections for menu items?



RADIO BUTTONS:
It's great except it's saving the form if you hit add form, but not if you
hit done. !!Done button on orderform is NOT a submit!!, that's why it is acting confusing.
I don't know how to keep it working because it is very unclear especailly when
in UpdateView. Maybe get rid of button.


ACCESS_LEVELS:
Permissions for form views,

We need security measures at least in all the forms. I can still manually
type the url to get anywhere I shouldn't be. I put one in order form
and one in menuitem form.
